# This file can be empty, or if you have initialization code for the routes package
# you can put it here. For example:

# from flask import Blueprint

# main_bp = Blueprint('main', __name__)
# auth_bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__)
# admin_bp = Blueprint('admin', __name__)

# Then, import the routes from the individual files:
# from . import main, auth, admin
